## :question: About

**go-grip** is a lightweight, Go-based tool designed to render Markdown files locally, replicating GitHub's style. It offers features like syntax highlighting, dark mode, and support for mermaid diagrams, providing a seamless and visually consistent way to preview Markdown files in your browser.

This project is a reimplementation of the original Python-based [grip](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip), which uses GitHub's web API for rendering. By eliminating the reliance on external APIs, go-grip delivers similar functionality while being fully self-contained, faster, and more secure - perfect for offline use or privacy-conscious users.

## :hammer: Usage

To render the `README.md` file simply execute:

```bash
go-grip README.md
# or
go-grip
```

The browser will automatically open on http://localhost:6419. You can disable this behaviour with the `-b=false` option.

You can also specify a port:

```bash
go-grip -p 80 README.md
```

or just open a file-tree with all available files in the current directory:

```bash
go-grip -r=false
```

It's also possible to activate the darkmode:

```bash
go-grip -d .
```

To terminate the current server simply press `CTRL-C`.
